# Difference-Objects-Classes

## Objects vs Classes in Java

A class is a blueprint or template used to define the structure and behavior of objects. It specifies what data an object will store and what actions it can perform, but it does not represent a real-world entity by itself.

An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real entity created from the class blueprint. Objects store actual values in memory and can use the methods defined by their class.

The key difference is that a class defines what something is, while an object represents an actual thing created from that definition. One class can be used to create many objects, each with its own data.

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the difference between classes and objects using a simple `Car` class. The `Car` class defines the structure of a car, while multiple car objects are created and used in the `Main` class.

## How to Run

1. Compile the project
2. Run `Main.java`
3. Observe how multiple objects are created from the same class
